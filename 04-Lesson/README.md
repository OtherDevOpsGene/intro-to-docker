# Lesson 4- Use Pre-Built Images

## Using Docker Hub

To go along with the `docker push` command to upload an image to a repository,
there is a corresponding [docker pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/)
to download. We've been implicitly using it whenever we used `docker run` with
an image we hadn't already downloaded.

Download the image for Nginx.

```console
$ docker pull nginx:latest
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
bb79b6b2107f: Already exists
5a9f1c0027a7: Pull complete
b5c20b2b484f: Pull complete
166a2418f7e8: Pull complete
1966ea362d23: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:aeade65e99e5d5e7ce162833636f692354c227ff438556e5f3ed0335b7cc2f1b
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
docker.io/library/nginx:latest
```

Bring up the default web page by running a container using that image.

```console
$ docker run --name www -d -p 8080:80 nginx
86399e1236346567a3eb82b1dc4cab4958e551910f87f53b07064b6f9c262c0c
```

* `--name www` name the container `www` rather than assigning a random name
* `-d` detaches after the container starts, meaning that it keeps running in the
  background (short for `--detach`)
* `-p 8080:80` exposes port 80 on the container, mapping it to port 8080 on the
  host (short for `--publish`)

You'll notice the prompt returns immediately. You can actually see that the
container is still running with `docker ps`.

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
86399e123634        nginx               "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   www
```

Follow the logs with `docker logs www --follow`, and then open your browser and
point to the new web site on port 8080. If you are running locally, you might be
able to hit <http://localhost:8080/>. Otherwise, use the IP address of your host
(e.g., <http://44.55.66.77:8080/>).

You should see the default Nginx page in your browser and the browser access in
the logs.

```console
$ docker logs www --follow

```

You can use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></kbd> to stop following the log
file.

Since the container is still running, stop the container using
[docker stop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/).

```console
$ docker stop www
www
```

Even though the container is stopped, the name `www` is still being used (e.g.,
see `docker ps -a`). If we ran another container with the same name, Docker
would report an error. So we'll have to remove the container using
[docker rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm/) so we can
reuse the container name.

```console
$ docker run --name www -d -p 8080:80 nginx
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/www" is already in use by container "86399e1236346567a3eb82b1dc4cab4958e551910f87f53b07064b6f9c262c0c". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
See 'docker run --help'.
$ docker rm www
www
```

## A Static Web site

We can use the `--volume` mapping from the end of the previous lesson with the
Nginx image to stand up a local web server.

Clone a sample application (`solarsystem`) we'll use for the remaining lessons,
and switch into the `solarsystem/nginx/docroot/` directory.

```console
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/SteampunkFoundry/solarsystem.git
Cloning into 'solarsystem'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 109, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (109/109), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (52/52), done.
remote: Total 109 (delta 30), reused 96 (delta 24), pack-reused 0R
Receiving objects: 100% (109/109), 26.57 KiB | 4.43 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (30/30), done.
$ cd ~/solarsystem/nginx/docroot/
```

Now run an Nginx container, mounting the current directory as
`/usr/share/nginx/html` on the container, and exposing the HTTP port on the
standard port 80 on the host.

```console
$ docker run --name www -d -p 80:80 --volume ${PWD}:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
faee144436fd5fb6a00dd2f13334a4a02054571495a1faac18f38a23477ff632
```

Open your browser and point to the new web site with <http://localhost/>
(or the IP address of your host, <http://44.55.66.77/>). You'll see
[index.html](https://github.com/SteampunkFoundry/solarsystem/blob/main/nginx/docroot/index.html)
rendered.

![Planets in the Solar System](planets-in-the-solar-system.png?raw=true
"Static HTML page")

On the host, any changes you make to `index.html` or any files you add to the
`solarsystem/nginx/docroot/` directory will be served up by Nginx.

When you are done, you can stop and remove the container in one step with
`docker rm --force`.

```console
$ docker rm --force www
www
```

We'll make this more capable by using multiple containers together using code
with `docker-compose` in [Lesson 5- Handle Multiple Containers](../05-Lesson/README.md).
